Have you been to the holy site, little creature?
When our creators were around they frequently sent us material from there so we could analyze it,<LINE>the material that had been there a long time had this "energy" infused within it,<LINE>it’s hard to describe without getting technical.
This is a very interesting find because this pearl has been abandoned there long enough for it to be affected.
The pearl was not originally green, subsurface data imply this pearl was originally white,<LINE>even stranger though is that the information inside it has been partially overwritten with a vision of lights moving erratically on a completely black environment.
…
I’m already plenty busy just trying to maintain operations so I can't analyze it further,<LINE>though if my condition improves i’ll be sure to take a proper look.
